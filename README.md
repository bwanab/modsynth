# modsynth

A modular synth system somewhat along the lines of PD, but at a higher level of abstraction. A closer analogy is Alsa Modular Synth orignally built by Matthias Nagorni.

## Usage

(use 'modsynth.core)
(-main)

## Roadmap

### What it still needs before it's usable:
1. Save/restore dialog
2. save/restore needs to be better tested.
3. Save values for sliders and const.
4. Fix slider.
5. A disconnect method.
6. splitter and mixer nodes for audio and control.
7. More synth types:
* Random note and timing
* some kind of file input for compositions if there is an overtone standard use that.
